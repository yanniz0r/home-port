# Home Port

> Get back to place that feels like home, that gives you warmth and love - The start page of your browser.

Home Port is a project with the goal of creating a unique browser starting point. However, it's also a project for me to learn vue. Feel free to contribute if you find this repository.

## Project setup

To enable unsplash, you have to create a .env file with your [secrets](https://unsplash.com/developers) in them. It should look like the following:

```
VUE_APP_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=<access key>
VUE_APP_UNSPLASH_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret access key>
```

To install this beast, run:

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
